I have to say the Prime Minister has done this with a very far-sighted Vision assoc as I said honestly has been more about and I really think that if there are those of us who are well-wishers of Sark this opportunity should be grabbed by side with both hands sock is ideally suited to face Regional disaster scenarios. 
the most productive organization when it comes to trade investment and so on and so be it that's fine but we know that this region suffers from floods this region has a human development index which is not the best this region has other diseases communicable or non-communicable diseases and now it's cause we have this enormous courage called coronavirus to my way of looking at it would beat that if so. 
can make use of the opportunity to reinvent itself and even if it can devote itself to bringing the region together when does the disaster stabbing you in the face I think it would have served the purpose so that is the way I interpret the prime minister's proposal I mean pulling up scientific resources there is an invention there is a vaccine that is going to be invented in India I go today. 
obviously we will make it available for the region that is that is the minimum that one can expect from sock and maybe there are other countries which can contribute in other ways so I really believe quite apart from the intrinsic Merit of the prime minister's proposal if I was a sarc enthusiastic in fact if I was a member of the Secretariat I would grab this proposal with both my hands and say hey this is a wonderful opportunity to. 
he invents talked to give it momentum and to really get it going because we've had trouble doing that precisely in the absolutely of optical modern oldest we should be a step in the direction of the goal that the United of India becoming the regional healthcare provider thank you so much and basico Marfa speaking to us on you last night who are now meeting of the Embargo group of four officers are to attack of the challenges emerging as a result of.

is not really the time to make any statement that could be interpreted by anybody as representing patinas I thought the explanation provided by Pakistan was far from convincing that they didn't participate because the sock Secretariat was not that you looking at a country like India which is going out of its way to contribute to the fight against. 
coronavirus in countries like Sri Lanka Bangladesh Myanmar and not to mention United States and Israel frankly we haven't even talked about that so for somebody to say we will not do this because this our secretary is not that I really am happy that the government of India has not reacted to this age shouldn't because you don't have to dignify the reaction by the comment by a response it is really not worthy of respect. 
this is a collective fight this is a collective fight writing India's done absolutely the right thing in terms of Kobe planted see how to tell us about the implications of covid-19 actions being undertaken under the subframe book because everything that moves with consensus then you need consensus as far as the building the agendas concerned or even an outcome document is it a flip side to all of this. 
this Pakistan Pops needs to understand look it's like this Sark is based on two things one you need to keep bilateral political disputes out of its Ambit and this is something that the sock Founders understood very well because if you do that then you bring into you know it's not just two or three countries we we could have differences with other countries as well and that would completely. 
poison the atmosphere the second thing about sock is that yes you need a consensus but my interpretation of sod is that you need a consensus to have a stop Summit of leaders nothing prevents Ark from actually focusing on publicly funded programs for the survival of the region and I think it doesn't matter if one or two countries don't participate I think we should go ahead. 
love countries which one to cooperate and I'm not talkin of summit level meetings and so on but if people want to focus on public health if people want to focus on combating the Regionals cuz you like coronavirus I think the Sark should be able to I love that and this will be an important but more importantly Pakistan is not that we are contributing what our contribution is conditional my reaction. 
that would be so be it it's fine I think other countries will understand that if there is a country which is contributing on the basis of some conditions so be it but that should prevent other countries from going forward and cooperating for the well-being of the region stock video conference he said that they should be a common research platform Beachwood coordinator results. 
action by various countries besides that he spoke about pulling in the best practices of various countries he supposed to start in response fun there in India made an initial with Midol for 10 million dollars the highest the other seven countries as well and then me and said that in there would have them stand by a team of Specialists and doctors with all the required equipment at the disposal of old apartment countries in these are just a few of the many suggestions that he had.
